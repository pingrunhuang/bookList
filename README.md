# Open source my book list
The books inside this repo is mostly downloads from the internet. Some of them might be from the other repo, some of them might be from the internet and some of them are bought by me. 

# Why am I doing this?
After watched the documentary called "The son of Internet" which talked about how Aaron Schwartz fight for the public to freely access the document that are kept by few people even the pressure got him suicide eventually, I think it is our duty not just to take from others but also to contribute. Don't take everything for granted. So I created this repo to all the books to the public.
